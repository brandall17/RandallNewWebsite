Starting in the seventh grade, I tried out for basketball. I didn't make it. It gave me the motivation to put in the time and effort to consistently practice basketball every day. Come eigth grade, I made the team and had a great season. I then had a successful career in highschool that you can see <a href= https://youtu.be/nj3RXna-2Ng">here.</a> I was very close to playing college basketball, I then decided to pursue academics and come to UW Madison! I now play on the club basketball team here at Wisconsin and run Badger Barstool</span></span><br />
